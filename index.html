<h1>Thanks for installing Qatar Blocker.</h1>

<h2>Boycott the organisator,<br>not the game.</h2>

<p>
    You love football, the game, the players, your team! But you’re not so happy with the organising country? We get it! That’s why we created the Qatar Blocker. From now on, everytime the name of the country, cities or stadiums appear, they will be blacked out.

    Oh yeah, and because you are a good person, you can donate 10 cents to Amnesty International every time you do read about the worldcup.
